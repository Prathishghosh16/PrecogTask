Task 1: Dataset Exploration
-  I first found out the number of edges in the graph along with the types of edges.
- Next, I found out the number of components which make up the graph. I found out that there are 50 components each consisting of either 26 or 27 nodes. 
-  Each such component of 26 or 27 nodes isn't connected to any other nodes. This indicates that each such component is a separate family consisting of 26 or 27 members.
